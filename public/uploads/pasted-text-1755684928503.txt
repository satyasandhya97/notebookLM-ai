1. Virtual DOM
React uses a Virtual DOM to optimize UI rendering. Instead of updating the entire real DOM directly, React:

Creates a lightweight copy of the DOM (Virtual DOM).
Compares it with the previous version to detect changes (diffing).
Updates only the changed parts in the actual DOM (reconciliation), improving performance.
