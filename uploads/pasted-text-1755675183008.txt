Advantages of React
Composable: React allows building reusable components, improving code organization and maintainability.
Declarative: React’s declarative approach makes it easy to design interactive UIs by changing component states, with React handling the DOM updates.
SEO-Friendly: React’s Single Page Application (SPA) setup can be optimized for SEO by rendering and indexing content properly.
Large Community: React has a strong community and is widely used by major companies like Meta, Netflix, making it easier to find resources and support.
Easy to Learn: React uses JSX, which resembles HTML, making it simple for developers with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Easy Debugging: React’s unidirectional data flow simplifies debugging by ensuring that data moves in a clear, predictable direction within components.
