React Components
Last Updated : 11 Aug, 2025
In React, components are reusable, independent code blocks (A function or a class) that define the structure and behavior of the UI. They accept inputs (props or properties) and return elements that describe what should appear on the screen.

Key Concepts of React Components:

Each component handles its own logic and UI rendering.
Components can be reused throughout the app for consistency.
Components accept inputs via props and manage dynamic data using state.
Only the changed component re-renders, not the entire page.
